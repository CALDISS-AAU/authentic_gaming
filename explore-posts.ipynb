       "\"I played WoW from patch 1.4 until Sunwell. And I'm not convinced on Classic. 1. I understand nostalgia for the gameplay, and it was a great game, by I don't get why people would want the old graphics when it looked outdated back then. Someone will level a warrior or rogue at snail pace and those 2004 boring graphics will reinforce his perception that the game is bad because it looks bad. 2. The lack of a second talent tree. This was the most demanded feature and I don't see people sticking with the game without it. 3. This has always been in the game, but weekly resets, I never got it, let people able to reset raids. Maybe have a 2 hours cooldown, but if a guild wants to farm a raid every night, or twice on a sunday, or farm the first 3 bosses of MC, let them. Gearing 40-60 people with weekly resets, in this day and age, good luck. 4. Dungeon finder, not sure people will like that, again bad decision. 5. The graphics, no seriously, this is bad on every level of game design, it just make the game look worse, a straight negative with no benefit.\""

       "\"Unlike the purist, I don't see Classic as exact 1 to 1 copy of what was. What I see is mechanics and cosmetics. Mechanics are important, for they are the gameplay. Cosmetics are not - they are personal art tastes. So Dungeon-finder is BAD, as it kills travel and forging of in game friendship. New graphics for models - are fine, it doesn't affect anything for gameplay. Raid reset times are tricky. While I agree that 15 years ago player crowd were more tuned to the idea that raid needed 40+ people kill a boss (I am coming from EverQuest where 70+ man raids were mandatory). As WoW got more casual over the years, very few would actually play that. On other hand, more raids per week - mean more loot coming in they not suppose to have.\""
